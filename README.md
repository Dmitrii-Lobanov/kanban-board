# Reliable Kanban Board

> A production-oriented Kanban application built with React, TypeScript, NestJS, and PostgreSQL, demonstrating frontend architecture, optimistic UI, backend engineering, authentication, concurrency control, and production-grade testing.

This project accompanies the Medium article **Designing and Implementing a Reliable Kanban Board in React: Optimistic Updates, Concurrency, and State Modeling**.

The repository started as a frontend architecture case study and is now evolving into a complete full-stack application following a documented implementation roadmap. The goal is not to build another CRUD demo, but to showcase engineering decisions behind a production-ready collaborative application.

# Why this project?

Most Kanban tutorials demonstrate drag-and-drop.

Real production applications require significantly more engineering:

- optimistic UI
- rollback
- concurrent mutations
- backend consistency
- authentication
- authorization
- conflict detection
- maintainable architecture
- reliable testing
- deployment

This repository documents the implementation of those concerns step by step.

---

# Frontend Features

- ✅ Optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Automatic rollback
- ✅ Per-task pending state
- ✅ Concurrent mutations
- ✅ Native HTML Drag & Drop
- ✅ Accessible keyboard movement
- ✅ Search
- ✅ Filtering
- ✅ Derived state
- ✅ Inline task errors
- ✅ Unit tests
- ✅ Integration tests

# Frontend Architecture

```text
apps/web/src
│
├── api
├── components
├── domain
├── hooks
├── data
└── test
```

Presentation, business logic, asynchronous mutations, and state transformations are separated to keep the application predictable and maintainable.

---

# State Model

Instead of storing multiple collections, the application keeps a single task collection and derives every UI representation.

| State           | Purpose                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| confirmedTasks  | Server-confirmed state  |
| optimisticTasks | Temporary optimistic UI |
| pendingTaskIds  | Per-task loading        |
| taskErrors      | Inline errors           |
| searchQuery     | Search                  |
| assigneeFilter  | Filtering               |
